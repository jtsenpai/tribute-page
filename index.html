        Ezio was born into Italian nobility from Florence in the year 1459. His
        family had long been loyal to the Assassin Brotherhood, a fictional
        organization inspired by the real-life Order of Assassins dedicated to
        protecting peace and freedom, but Ezio did not learn about his Assassin
        heritage until his late teens, after most of his immediate kin were
        killed during the Pazzi conspiracy. His quest to track down those
        responsible for killing his family eventually sets him up against the
        villainous Templar Order led by the House of Borgia. Spending years to
        fight against Rodrigo and Cesare Borgia and their henchmen, he
        eventually re-establishes the Brotherhood as the dominant force in
        Italy. His further adventures lead him to Spain and the Ottoman Empire,
        where he is also essential in overcoming Templar threats and restoring
        the Assassins. After his retirement from the Brotherhood, he lives a
        peaceful life in rural Tuscany until his eventual death from a heart
        attack in 1524.
